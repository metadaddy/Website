# **Welcome to the World of EUC**
## Who we are

## Where we came from
There are many great community initiatives out there. Many of these initiatives existed within unique and individual slack channels or private forums. So far we have consolidated the following resources into world of EUC
- World of WEM - Slack Channel
- FSLogix Community - Slack Channel
- NetScaler

## Why we are here
Our aim is to provide a central and community based platform to allow like minded individuals across the globe to collaborate with each other.

We also aim to offer an environment for all Vendors, products, solution providers to participate in active communications with end users, in whatever level they feel is appropriate. We have active product managers from select technology providers who are actively involved in these channels.

No tricks, not BS, no politics, no allegiances to anything other than open sharing.
## Rules of Engagement
- **We will not tolderate abuse, politics or any form of crap against another member of this community**
- We aim to, and will consistently ask you to utilise threads within the slack channels. We expect a level of professionalism and courtesy - **threads are critical**
## Platform
We currently operate using the Slack platform. It's not perfect but it provides a uniformly understood solution that is easy to drive
## How to get involved
We are not currently sponsored. We fund this platform (hosting, admin time etc) out of our on pockets. And we do so happily

If anyone has ideas or contributions they would like to add to this community, we are open to ideas. We welcome input and contributions in any way, however our core focus will be one of community and we will keep to that core above anything else. Should you wish to contribute and help in any way, do so knowing that we will not push any particular solution or technology
